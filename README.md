#### About the Map

This map depicts the locations of USAID-funded projects to better monitor development results, improve aid effectiveness and coordination, and enhance transparency and social accountability. The map provides two ways to view projects: a Project view or a Project Location view, which the user can adjust with the toggle on the left-hand side of the map. The Project view provides a summary of USAID funded projects in a particular country. A Project Location view depicts the total number of unique projects at the administrative one boundary level (i.e. region, state, province) of a country. For example, a Global Health project may operate in several provinces within a country, in which case it will be given a count of one in each of those provinces. A project count will not be given to a province if that project does not operate there.


#### Disclaimer

The geographic names and boundaries may not reflect the views of the United States Government on the sovereignty over geographic features. A subset of USAIDâ€™s field offices participated in the initial rollout of the map. Over time the intent is to display a comprehensive portfolio of USAID projects from all international locations.
